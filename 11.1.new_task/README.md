## new_task

Create a FreeRTOS task **WITHOUT** using CubeMX. 

There are two tasks in this example. The first is *defaultTask* generated by CubeMX. It runs on 1s interval and always turns on on-board LED. The second is *offTask* defined by source code in main.c file. This task runs on 1.1s interval and always turns off on-board LED. Difference in interval makes harmonics on blinking timing of LED.
